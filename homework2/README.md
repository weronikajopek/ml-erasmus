# Logistic Regression & Decision Tree from Scratch

This project demonstrates three custom implementations:
- **Logistic Regression** with:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss**
  - **Cross-Entropy Loss**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

These models are compared with **scikit-learn's** built-in versions on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Each model is trained using **gradient descent** for logistic regression and **recursive splitting** for the decision tree, with performance tracked over time.
